        <ul>
          <li>Updated to run on Raspberry Pi 4B
          <li>Updated to run under <a class="text-danger" href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a>
          <li>Added the ability to display <a class="text-danger" href="https://www.aviationweather.gov/static/help/taf-decode.php" target="_blank">TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts)</a>.
          <li>Added the ability to display <a class="text-danger" href="https://www.weather.gov/mdl/mos_home" target="_blank">MOS (Model Output Statistics)</a>. Only available for the United States and its Territories.
          <li>Added the ability to decode METARs from weather stations not located on airports, such as KMYP - 	Monarch Pass, CO. (Thank you Nick C.)
          <li>Heat Map was added to display what airports have been landed at, and how often. Home airport can be designated.
	  <li>Added the ability to install a rotary switch so viewer can select what data to display, METAR's, TAF's, MOS or Heat Map.
          <li>If rotary switch is not installed, the software can set a default data to display. i.e. METAR's.
          <li>Sleep Timer - The Map can be put to sleep at night (or anytime) if desired. Pressing a pushbutton will turn on temporarily.
          <li>Reload the config settings automatically. The map will restart and reload the settings when new settings are saved.
          <li>Map builder has the ability to use both types of LED's, either RGB and/or GRB color encoding on same map.
          <li>Decodes the airport ID to show City and State. If international airports are used, it will show Site and Country.  
          <li>Will display IP address if an LCD/OLED display is used.
	  <li>Logging capabilities were added to help with diagnosing issues.
          <li>The builder can now download and backup the config file, airports file, Heat Map file and logfile.
          <li>The builder can import a config file and airports file to make maintenance and upgrading easier.
          <li>Wind direction can now be displayed using an arrow or numbers in degrees and includes Gusts as well.
          <li>The user interface was improved to optimize for mobile applications.
          <li>Config Profiles available to load to help start the configuration process.
          <li>Many new Transitional Wipes were added for when the FAA weather is being updated. Some are still a work in process.
          <li>Ability to setup wifi remotely through the use of Android or IPhone app thanks to  <a class="text-danger" href="http://berrylan.org" target="_blank">Berrylan.org</a>.
          <li>A System Information page was added to help with diagnosis if necessary.
          <li>A Phone App was added to allow the casual user to control the data displayed on the map if a Rotary Switch was not installed. (Thank you Lance B.)
          <li>To help the casual user to access the App, a 'Create QR Code' feature was added to Utilities to display next to the map.
          <li>Added the ability to set the RPI's Time Zone without needing to enter the command line.
          <li>Added the ability to expand RPI's file system without needing to enter the command line.
          <li>Added the ability to rotate OLED display 180 degrees, and to reverse the position order of OLED's due to build constraints.
          <li>Added a Map Layout page that will provide a graphical representation of the map design and LED routing.
          <li>Added ability for more than 300 airports on a single map. Thank you Daniel.
          <li>Increased the max number of airports from 500 to 3000 in 'Basic Settings'
