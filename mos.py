# MOS decode routine
# MOS data is downloaded daily from; https://www.weather.gov/mdl/mos_gfsmos_mav to the local drive by crontab scheduling.
# Then this routine can be called to read through the entire file looking for those airports that are in the airports file. 
# If airport is found, the data is populated into a dictionary with the following format and then returned:
#  {
#    "AirportID": {
#      "YYYYMMDDHH": {
#        "Category1": "Value",
#        "Category2": "Value"
#        etc etc
#      }
#    }
#  }

# See; https://www.weather.gov/mdl/mos_gfsmos_mavcard 
# for a breakdown of what the MOS data looks like and what each line represents.
