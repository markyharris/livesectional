Version 4.600
9-6-2025
Once again the FAA has changed their schema for the API. See https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/#changes 
for information on the changes. These changes broke 2 programs, wipes-v4.py and metar-v4.py. A huge thanks 
needs to go to Greg C for taking the bull by the horns and fixing these 2 files. Because of his quick efforts 
this new image was posted in record time.
The following file was updated;
  metar-v4.py
  wipes-v4.py
  admin.py
  update_version.text
  templates/apedit.html
Again, Thank you Greg C

Version 4.501
11-20-2023
This version starts the use of the new FAA API, https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/#/Dataserver/dataserverMetars
This API provides more than the last reported, and therefore takes a tiny bit more time filtering out the older
METAR's. So depending on the number of airports, this may or may not be noticable. 
The following files have been modified to reflect the backup legacy API URL;
  wipes-v4.py
  metar-v4.py
  admin.py
  update_version.text
Much thanks to Livesectional user Marty for his time and expertise.

  metar-display-v4.py
