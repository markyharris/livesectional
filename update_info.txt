Version 4.501
11-20-2023
This version starts the use of the new FAA API, https://aviationweather.gov/data/api/#/Dataserver/dataserverMetars
This API provides more than the last reported, and therefore takes a tiny bit more time filtering out the older
METAR's. So depending on the number of airports, this may or may not be noticable. 
The following files have been modified to reflect the backup legacy API URL;
  wipes-v4.py
  metar-v4.py
  admin.py
  update_version.text
Much thanks to Livesectional user Marty for his time and expertise.

Version 4.400
10-19-2023

  metar-display-v4.py
  webapp.py
  admin.py
