#metar-v4.py - by Mark Harris. Capable of displaying METAR data, TAF or MOS data. Using a rotary switch to select 1 of 12 positions
#    Updated to run under Python 3.7
#    Added Sleep Timer routine to turn-off map at night if desired.
#    Added the ability to display TAF or MOS data along with METAR's
#    Note: MOS data is only available for United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
#    The timeframe of the TAF, MOS data to display can be selected via the rotary switch. A switch with up to 12 positions can be used.
#    If no Rotary Switch is used, this script's config will set default data to display.
#    Added routine by by Nick Cirincione to decode flight category if flight category is not provided by the FAA.
#    Fixed bug that wouldn't allow the last airport to be 'NULL' without causing all LED's to show white.
#    Added auto restart when config.py is changed, so settings will be automatically re-loaded.
#    Added internet availability check and retry if necessary. This should help when power is disrupted and board reboots before router does.
#    Added Logging capabilities which is stored in /NeoSectional/logfile.log with 3 backup files for older logfile data.
#    Added ability to specify specific LED pins to reverse the normal rgb_grb setting. For mixing models of LED strings.
#    Added a Heat Map of what airports the user has landed at. Not available through Rotary switch. Only Web interface.
#    Added new wipes, some based on lat/lon of airports
#    Fixed bug where wipes would execute twice on map startup.
#    Added admin.py for behinds the scenes variables to be stored. i.e. use_mos=1 to determine if bash files should or should not download MOS data.
#    Added ability to detect a Rotary Switch is NOT installed and react accordingly.
#    Added logging of Current RPI IP address whenever FAA weather update is retrieved
#    Fixed bug where TAF XML reports OVC without a cloud level agl. It uses vert_vis_ft as a backup.
#    Fixed bug when debug mode is changed to 'Debug'.
#    Switch Version control over to Github at https://github.com/markyharris/livesectional
#    Fixed METAR Decode routine to handle FAA results that don't include flight_category and forecast fields.
#    Added routine to check time and reboot each night if setting in admin.py are set accordingly.
#    Fixed bug that missed lowest sky_condition altitude on METARs not reporting flight categories.

#This version retains the features included in metar-v3.py, including hi-wind blinking and lightning when thunderstorms are reported.
#However, this version adds representations for snow, rain, freezing rain, dust sand ash, and fog when reported in the metar.
#The LED's will show the appropriate color for the reported flight category (vfr, mvfr, ifr, lifr) then blink a specific color for the weather
#For instance, an airport reporting IFR with snow would display Red then blink white for a short period to denote snow. Blue for rain,
#purple for freezing rain, brown for dust sand ash, and silver for fog. This makes for a colorful map when weather is in the area.
#A home airport feature has been added as well. When enabled, the map can be dimmed in relation to the home airport as well as
#have the home alternate between weather color and a user defined marker color(s).
#Most of these features can be disabled to downgrade the map display in the user-defined variables below.

#For detailed instructions on building an Aviation Map, visit http://www.livesectional.com
#Hardware features are further explained on this site as well. However, this software allows for a power-on/update weather switch,
#and Power-off/Reboot switch. The use of a display is handled by metar-display.py and not this script.
